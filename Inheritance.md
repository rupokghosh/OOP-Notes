# Inheritance


Inheritance - is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a class (subclass/child) to inherit properties and behaviors from another class (superclass/parent). It creates an is-a relationship.

### Why Inheritance?
1. Code reusability: Inherited classes can reuse the fields and methods of the parent class.
2. Extensibility: New functionalities can be added to the subclass without modifying the parent class.

### Declaration:

```
class Subclass extends Superclass {
    // subclass members
}
```
### Access Modifiers in Inheritance ( 4 Types)

- Public - these are accessible in the subclass. 
- Protected - these are accessible in the subclass and package. 
- Default (Package-Private) - only accessible within the same package. 
- Private - these are not directly accessible in the subclass. 

---
### The Super Keyword:
- Used to call the methods of the superclass.
- Used to invoke the superclass constructor since constructors are not inherited. 

```
class Subclass extends Superclass {
    @Override
    void display() {
        super.display(); // Calling the superclass method
        System.out.println("Subclass");
    }
}
```

### Types of Inheritance 
1. Single Inheritance - Java supports single inheritance, meaning that a derived class can have only one parent class. 
2. Multiple Inheritance - Multiple Inheritance allows a class to be derived from two or more classes, inheriting the members of all parents. 
It is NOT supported in Java. 

We can, however, use interfaces, which gives us aspects of multiple inheritance without the overhead.

### Overriding Methods 
A child class can override the definition of an inherited method in favor of its own. 
It must have the same signature as the parent’s method, but can have a different body. 

```
class Superclass {
    void display() {
        System.out.println("i like cricket!");
    }
}

class Subclass extends Superclass {
    @Override
    void display() {
        System.out.println("i like football!");
    }
}
```
- A method cannot be overiden if its declared with the final modifier. 
- A method in the parent class can be invoked explicitly using the super reference.

### Overloading Methods
Multiple method with the same name in the same class but with different signatures. 
It lets you define a similar operation in different ways for different parameters.

### The Object Class

- Every class in Java is a subclass of the **`Object`** class.
- If a class doesn't explicitly extend another class, it implicitly inherits from **`Object`**.
- The **`Object`** class provides basic methods that are common to all Java objects.

A couple of important and common methods of the **Object Class**:
1. **`toString()`**: Returns a string representation of the object ( name of the object’s class along with some other info )
2. **`equals(Object obj)`**: Indicates whether some other object is "equal to" this one ( it returns true if two references are aliases )

---
### The Abstract Class
- An abstract class cannot be instantiated and may contain abstract methods (methods with only a signature but no body). It is basically a placeholder that represents a generic concept.
- Unlike an *interface*, the **abstract** modifier must be applied to each abstract method.
- The child of an abstract class **must** override the abstract methods of the parent.
- An abstract method can be defined as *final* or *static*.

---
### The Final Keyword
- **Final Class:**
    - A final class cannot be extended.
- **Final Method:**
    - A final method cannot be overridden by subclasses.
- **Final Variable:**
    - A final variable is a constant and cannot be reassigned.

### Visibility

Visibility and Inheritance aren’t the best of friends. If private members are inherited, 
they can be referenced indirectly ( using super )by the child class using its parent’s methods. 

### A few Inheritance design techniques: 
1. llow each class to manage its own data and use super reference to invoke the parent’s constructor. 
2. Override methods such as toString and equals with proper definitions. 
3. Use abstract classes for general concepts that other classes might have in common.
